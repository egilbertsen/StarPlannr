# StarPlannr

## User story

As an amateur astronomer, I would like to know the suitability of the weather, moon, etc. for stargazing, 
given a date and location. The information should make it easy to decide whether the conditions
will be good or bad.

## App functionality

The user will have the option to select a date as well as their choice of location. The user
will be presented with the weather, cloud cover opacity percentage, sunrise, sunset, moonrise, moonset, 
location of the ISS, as well as providing an overall designation of the night's suitability for stargazing.


This app will be built using the Foundation framework.


The following APIs will be used to populate our data-fields:
